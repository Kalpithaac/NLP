provider, your out -of-\\npocket costs may be higher than if y ou had used a participating provider. for example, if \\nyour provider’s charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the \\nremaining $100 balance billing amount.  \\nexceptions  \\nthere are certain exceptions to the rule of non -participating pr oviders. your health plan \\nmay cover emergency services

services, be sure to check \\nwith your health plan first. there may be an exception that wil l cover the cost of the service. \\nadditionally, if you need to use a non -participating provider and you

\\nfor example, copays for office visits with a prima ry care physician may be $20, while copays \\nfor a hospital visit may be up to $150. it is important to note that the copays may vary from \\nprovider to provider and from state to state.  \\nin addition to office visits, copays may also apply to other services, su ch as prescriptions \\nand diagnostic testing. for example, copays for

plan has a calendar year deductible of $2,000 for each individual \\nand $4,000 for each family. a calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for \\nhealth care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. the deduct ible applies to most \\nservices received from in -network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, \\nhospitals, and pharmacies.  \\nhowever, there are some exceptions. for example, preventive care services, such as \\nimmunizations and annual physic als, are covered at 100% with no deductible. additionally, \\nprescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per \\nindividual and $500 per family.  \\nit is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. this means \\nthat you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins \\nto pay. additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. for  example, you may not \\nbe subject to the deductible when you receive in -network emergency services.  \\ntips for meeting the calendar year deductible  \\nmeeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a

providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are \\nnot paying more than you have to for services.  \\nthird, consider using a health savings account (h sa). an hsa is a tax -advantaged savings \\naccount that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. contributions to an hsa are \\ntax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical \\ncosts.  \\nfinally, take advantage of an y discount programs that may be available. many providers \\noffer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of \\nmoney you need to pay out of pocket.  \\nby following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible  and take \\nadvantage of the full benefits of the northwind standard plan.  \\ncoinsurance  \\nimportant plan information: coinsurance  \\ncoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your \\ndeductible. coinsurance is often a percentage  of the cost of the service you receive. for example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the \\nservice you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.  \\nunder northwind standard, coinsurance is set a t 20% for in -network services, with some \\nexceptions. for in -network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. additionally, \\ncoinsurance for out -of-network services is set at 40%.  \\nit’s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by \\nthe plan’s copayment amounts. copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for \\npaying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. additionally, \\nnorthwind standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care  services.  \\nwhen you receive services, it’s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure \\nyou are aware of any coinsurance costs. it’s also important to be aware of the coinsurance \\nrate for out -of-network services and to consider if it’s wort h the cost to pay more for out -of-\\nnetwork services.  \\nit’s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed \\namount for the service. this means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what \\nis allowed by the pl an, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the \\nactual cost.  \\nif you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, northwind standard \\nwill allow you to make payments over time. this is a great option for those who need \\nservices but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.  \\nfinally, it’s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out -of-pocket \\nmaximum. this means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your ou t-of-\\npocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket \\nfor services.  \\nin summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under northwind standard that is \\ntypically 20% for in -network services and 40% for out -of-networ k services. it’s important \\nto be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it’s worth the cost to \\npay more for out -of-network services. additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your \\nout-of-pocket maximum and you can make paymen ts over time if needed.  \\nout-of-pocket maximum  \\nimportant plan information: out -of-pocket maximum  \\nemployees enrolled in the northwind standard plan can benefit from an out -of-pocket \\nmaximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills. this limit appl ies to certain \\ncovered services and includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. the out -of-pocket \\nmaximum for the northwind standard plan is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a \\nfamily.  employees should be aware that certain services may not b e subject to the out -of-pocket \\nmaximum. these services include any charges that are not related to the diagnosis and \\ntreatment of an illness or injury. for example, non -covered services like cosmetic surgery, \\nnon-prescription drugs, or services that were p rovided outside of the northwind health \\nnetwork will not count toward the out -of-pocket maximum.  \\nit's important for employees to remember that the out -of-pocket maximum will reset at the \\nstart of the calendar year. this means that any out -of-pocket expense s paid during the \\nprevious year will not carry over to the new year.  \\nto keep track of their out -of-pocket expenses, employees should review their insurance \\nstatements regularly. they should also review their explanation of benefits (eob) \\ndocuments to make sure that all of their expenses have been properly accounted for. this \\ncan help them to stay on top of their out -of-pocket expenses and avoid exceeding the \\nmaximum.  \\nemployees should also be aware that the out -of-pocket maximum does not include the cost \\nof premiums. the cost of premiums is not counted toward the out -of-pocket maximum and \\nis in addition to any out -of-pocket expenses that employees incur.  \\nfinally, if employees are thinking of switching to a different health plan, they should be \\naware that out -of-pocket costs can vary from plan to plan. employees should compare the \\nout-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is \\nbest for them.  \\nin summary, the northwind standard plan offers employees an out -of-pocket maximum  of \\n$6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. employees should be aware that certain \\nservices are not subject to this maximum and that their out -of-pocket expenses will reset at \\nthe start of the calendar year. they should also remember that the ou t-of-pocket maximum \\ndoes not include the cost of premiums. finally, they should compare the out -of-pocket \\nmaximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them.  \\nallowed amount  \\nimportant plan information: allowed amount  \\nin the northwind standard plan, an allowed amount is the maximum amount that the plan \\nwill pay for a covered service. it includes both the amount that the plan pays and any \\namount that the insured is responsible for paying. this total allowed amount is usuall y a \\npercentage of the provider's charge. in some cases, the allowed amount may be a fixed \\namount.  \\nin general, the allowed amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's allowed \\namount, and the copayment amount. this means that the insured may be  responsible for \\npaying the difference between the provider's charge and the allowed amount.  it is important to remember that the allowed amount may not cover the entire cost of a \\nservice. therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining

health care plans  \\nit may be possible to coordinate benefits with other health care plans if you have other \\ncoverage. coordinating benefits allows you to receive payments from each health plan \\ntowards covered services, as long as the total amount of payments does not exceed the total \\ncharges for the service.  \\nif you have other coverage, such as medicare or an employer -sponsored health plan, the \\nnorthwind standard plan may be able to coordinate benefits with those plans. this can help \\nreduce your out -of-pocket costs for health  care services.  \\nhow do i coordinate benefits with other plans?  if you have other health care coverage, you should contact the other health care plan(s) to \\ndetermine how to coordinate benefits. depending on the plans you have, you may be able to \\ncoordinate  benefits by filing a claim with both plans.  \\nyou will need to provide the other plan with a copy of the explanation of benefits (eob) \\nfrom the northwind health plan. the eob is a summary of the services you received and \\nhow much the northwind health plan paid for those services.  \\nwhen filing a claim with the other health care plan, you may also need to provide a copy of \\nyour bill or invoice. the other plan may require additional information as part of the claim \\nprocess.  \\nyou should keep copies of all docum entation that you submit to the other plan. this can \\nhelp you track your claim and follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in \\nprocessing.  \\nexceptions  \\ncoordination of benefits with other plans is not available for all types of services. for \\nexample, coordination of benefits will not be available for services related to emergency \\ncare, mental health and substance abuse treatment, or services received from out -of-\\nnetwork providers.  \\ntips for coordinating benefits  \\n• contact your other health care plan to determine whether you can coordinate benefits and \\nwhat documentation you need to provide.  \\n• keep copies of all documentation you submit to the other plan, including bills and \\ninvoices.  \\n• follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in pro cessing the claim.  \\n• be sure to read all of the plan documents and understand your coverage options.  \\n• if you have any questions, contact the northwind health customer service team for \\nassistance.  \\ncob definitions  \\nwhat if i have other coverage?  \\nat contoso , we want our employees to understand the concept of cob (coordination of \\nbenefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage. \\ncob is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more \\nthan one health plan.  \\nwhen an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined \\nby the order of benefit determination. generally, the employee's primary health plan pays first, followed by the secondary health plan. however, i f one of the health plans is a \\nmedicare or medicaid plan, that plan pays first.  \\nunder the northwind standard plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the \\nnetwork providers and services that are covered by northwind standard at a lower cost.  \\nhowever, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the northwind \\nstandard network will not be covered by the plan.  \\nwhen you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the \\nprovider to ensure that the y bill each health plan appropriately. this helps to ensure that \\nyou receive the full benefits offered by each plan. if you do not identify all of your health \\ncoverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.  \\nwhen you submit a claim to northwind standard, you'll need to include information about \\nthe other coverage you have. if the claim is sent to northwind standard before any other \\nplan, the claim will be processed based on the northwind standard plan benefits.  \\nit's important to remembe r that northwind standard does not coordinate benefits with \\nother coverage. this means that northwind standard will not adjust the amount of payment \\nmade to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage. if a provider has \\nbeen paid by anothe r plan, you are still responsible for the balance due after northwind \\nstandard pays its portion of the claim.  \\nif you have other coverage, it's important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure \\nyou are taking full advantage of your coverage. if you  need help understanding your plan \\nbenefits or have any questions about the coordination of benefits, please contact the \\nnorthwind standard plan customer service team. we're here to help!  \\nprimary and secondary rules  \\nwhat if i have other coverage?  \\nif you ha ve other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse’s plan, northwind \\nstandard may become your secondary coverage. this means that northwind standard will \\npay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.  \\nthe primary and secondary rules that  apply to northwind standard are important to \\nunderstand. when you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and \\nthe secondary plan pays second. the primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying \\nthe largest portion of your he althcare costs.  \\nfor example, if you have a spouse’s health plan and northwind standard, your spouse’s plan \\nwould be the primary plan and northwind standard would be the secondary plan. this \\nmeans that your spouse’s plan would pay for the majority of your h ealthcare costs and \\nnorthwind standard would pay for any remaining costs.  \\nit’s important to note that northwind standard will only pay for expenses that are not \\ncovered by the primary plan. additionally, northwind standard will not pay any expenses that ex ceed the limits of the primary plan. for example, if the primary plan has a $1,000 \\ndeductible and northwind standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from \\nthe primary plan will be paid.  \\nthere are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. for instance, if you have \\nmedicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and northwind \\nstandard will be the secondary coverage. however, if you have medicare part d for \\nprescription drugs, northwind standard will be the prim ary coverage and medicare part d \\nwill be the secondary coverage.  \\nit’s also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to \\nprovide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. this is known as “creditable \\ncoverage,” and it helps to ensure that northwind standard will pay any eligible expenses \\nonce the primary plan has paid.  \\nwhen it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it’s important to remember \\nthat each health plan is different. be sure to review your plan  documents to understand the \\nspecific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage.  \\nfinally, if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage, be sure to reach out to \\nnorthwind health. their knowledgeable customer service representatives are  always \\navailable to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage.  \\ncob's effect on benefits  \\nwhat if i have other coverage?  \\nwhen you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (cob) can affect \\nhow your bene fits are paid. cob is a process where your insurance companies coordinate \\nwho pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical \\nexpenses. the insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer, and the \\ncompany that pays second is called the secondary payer.  \\ncoordination of benefits exceptions  \\nthere are a few exceptions to cob rules that may apply to you. if you are covered by \\nmedicare, medicaid, or a veterans’ health plan, northwind standard may pay first, even if \\nthe other plan is usually the primary payer. additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is \\nrequired by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer -sponsored plan, northwind \\nstandard may pay first.  \\nunderstanding how cob affects your benefits  \\nwhen cob applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible \\nexpenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. depending on the type of \\nservice, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. when this happen s, the \\nsecondary payer may pay nothing.  for example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the \\nsecondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. however, if the primary payer \\npays the full $1,000, the secondary pay er will not pay anything.  \\ntips for working with cob  \\nwhen you have multiple health insurance plans, it’s important to understand how cob \\nworks and how it can affect your benefits. here are a few tips to help you manage your \\nbenefits:  \\n• make sure that each i nsurance company has all of the necessary information about your \\nother coverage, including plan numbers and policy dates.  \\n• confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each \\nother.  \\n• ask your health care providers to submit  claims to both insurance companies.  \\n• understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits.  \\n• if you have questions, contact each insurance company for clarification.  \\noverall, it’s important to understand how cob works and how it affects your benefits. by \\nbeing aware of the rules and exceptions, you can ensure that you are getting the full \\ncoverage you need from both insurance companies.  \\nsubrogation and reimbursement  \\nsubrogation and reimbursement  \\nwhen you have other health coverage, such as medicare or another employer’s health plan, \\nnorthwind standard may still provide coverage in certain circumstances. this is called \\n“subrogation and reimbursement.” subrogation and reimbursement works when anothe r \\nhealth plan pays for a service that is covered by northwind standard. in this case, \\nnorthwind standard will pay for the same service, assuming that it was medically necessary \\nand you received it from an in -network provider.  \\nif northwind standard pays for  a service that is already covered by your other health plan, \\nyou may be responsible for reimbursing northwind standard. this can happen if you do not \\nprovide northwind standard with proof of your other coverage.  \\nthere are certain exceptions to subrogation  and reimbursement. if you are a medicare \\nbeneficiary, northwind standard will not seek reimbursement from medicare. in addition, \\nnorthwind standard will not seek reimbursement from any other health plan if the service \\nyou received is not covered by the ot her health plan.  \\nwhen filing claims, it is important to keep in mind that you need to provide northwind \\nstandard with proof of your other coverage. this can include a copy of your other plan’s explanation of benefits (eob) or a letter from the other health  plan stating that the service \\nis not covered.  \\nwhen providing proof of other coverage, it is important to remember to include the \\nfollowing information:  \\n• your name, address, and policy number  \\n• the name of the other health plan  \\n• the date of service for t he claim  \\n• the amount paid by the other health plan  \\n• any additional information required by northwind standard  \\nif you are unsure of what information to provide, you can always contact northwind \\nstandard for assistance.  \\nit is also important to remember tha t if you are filing claims with both northwind standard \\nand another health plan, you must submit a claim to northwind standard first. this will \\nallow northwind standard to determine if the service is covered and if you are eligible for \\nsubrogation or reimb ursement.  \\nfinally,

means \\nthat you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins \\nto pay Additionally the deductible may not apply to all services For  example you may not \\nbe subject to the deductible when you receive in network emergency services  \\nTips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible  \\nMeeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task but there are a few \\nsteps you can take to  help ensure that you reach it  \\nFirst take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100 These \\nservices are important for your health and you can use them to help meet your deductible \\nwithout paying out of pocket  \\nSecond use caut ion when selecting providers The Northwind Standard plan has a large \\nnetwork of in network providers and using these providers will help ensure that you are \\nnot paying more than you have to for services  \\nThird consider using a health savings account H SA An HSA is a tax advantaged savings \\naccount that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses Contributions to an HSA are \\ntaxdeductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical \\ncosts  \\nFinally take advantage of an y discount programs that may be available Many providers \\noffer discounts for cash payments on services and these can help reduce the amount of \\nmoney you need to pay out of pocket  \\nBy following these tips you can make sure that you reach your deductible  and take \\nadvantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan  \\nCoinsurance  \\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION Coinsurance  \\nCoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your \\ndeductible Coinsurance is often a percentage  of the cost of the service you receive For example if the coinsurance is 10 you will be responsible for paying 10 of the cost of the \\nservice you received while the insurance company pays the other 90  \\nUnder Northwind Standard coinsurance is set a t 20 for in network services with some \\nexceptions For in network hospital stays coinsurance is set at 25 Additionally \\ncoinsurance for out ofnetwork services is set at 40  \\nIt’s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by \\nthe plan’s copayment amounts Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for \\npaying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance Additionally \\nNorthwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care  services  \\nWhen you receive services it’s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure \\nyou are aware of any coinsurance costs It’s also important to be aware of the coinsurance \\nrate for out ofnetwork services and to consider if it’s wort h the cost to pay more for out of\\nnetwork services  \\nIt’s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed \\namount for the service This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what \\nis allowed by the pl an your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount not the \\nactual cost  \\nIf you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front Northwind Standard \\nwill allow you to make payments over time This is a great option for those who need \\nservices but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment  \\nFinally it’s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out ofpocket \\nmaximum This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your ou tof\\npocket maximum faster thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket \\nfor services  \\nIn summary coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is \\ntypically 20 for in network services and 40 for out ofnetwor k services It’s important \\nto be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it’s worth the cost to \\npay more for out ofnetwork services Additionally coinsurance costs count towards your \\noutofpocket maximum and you can make paymen ts over time if needed  \\nOutOfPocket Maximum  \\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION Out ofPocket Maximum  \\nEmployees enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan can benefit from an out ofpocket \\nmaximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills This limit appl ies to certain \\ncovered services and includes deductibles coinsurance and copayments The out ofpocket \\nmaximum for the Northwind Standard plan is 6350 for an individual and 12700 for a \\nfamily  Employees should be aware that certain services may not b e subject to the out ofpocket \\nmaximum These services include any charges that are not related to the diagnosis and \\ntreatment of an illness or injury For example non covered services like cosmetic surgery \\nnonprescription drugs or services that were p rovided outside of the Northwind Health \\nnetwork will not count toward the out ofpocket maximum  \\nIts important for employees to remember that the out ofpocket maximum will reset at the \\nstart of the calendar year This means that any out ofpocket expense s paid during the \\nprevious year will not carry over to the new year  \\nTo keep track of their out ofpocket expenses employees should review their insurance \\nstatements regularly They should also review their Explanation of Benefits EOB \\ndocuments to make sure that all of their expenses have been properly accounted for This \\ncan help them to stay on top of their out ofpocket expenses and avoid exceeding the \\nmaximum  \\nEmployees should also be aware that the out ofpocket maximum does not include the cost \\nof premiums The cost of premiums is not counted toward the out ofpocket maximum and \\nis in addition to any out ofpocket expenses that employees incur  \\nFinally if employees are thinking of switching to a different health plan they should be \\naware that out ofpocket costs can vary from plan to plan Employees should compare the \\noutofpocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is \\nbest for them  \\nIn summary the Northwind Standard plan offers employees an out ofpocket maximum  of \\n6350 for an individual and 12700 for a family Employees should be aware that certain \\nservices are not subject to this maximum and that their out ofpocket expenses will reset at \\nthe start of the calendar year They should also remember that the ou tofpocket maximum \\ndoes not include the cost of premiums Finally they should compare the out ofpocket \\nmaximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them  \\nAllowed Amount  \\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION ALLOWED AMOUNT  \\nIn the Northwind Standard plan an Allowed Amount is the maximum amount that the plan \\nwill pay for a covered service It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any \\namount that the insured is responsible for paying This total Allowed Amount is usuall y a \\npercentage of the providers charge In some cases the Allowed Amount may be a fixed \\namount  \\nIn general the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the providers charge the plans Allowed \\nAmount and the copayment amount This means that the insured may be  responsible for \\npaying the difference between the providers charge and the Allowed Amount  It is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a \\nservice Therefore the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance even if \\nit is more than the Allowed Amount  \\nExceptions  \\nIn some cases a service may not have an Allowed Amount or the Allowed Amount may be \\nhigher than the providers charge This may occur when the service is considered to be a \\nnoncovered serv ice or when the service is not a usual or customary service In these cases \\nthe insured will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the service  \\nIn addition some services may have a separate deductible or coinsurance amount that must \\nbe met before  the Allowed Amount is applied These services may include hospitalization \\nemergency services and certain types of outpatient services  \\nTips  \\nWhen selecting a provider ask the provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan and \\nwhat their Allowed Am ounts are This will ensure that you are selecting a provider that will \\naccept the plan and that you are aware of what your out ofpocket costs may be  \\nMake sure to keep all of your receipts and bills when you receive a service so that you can \\nreview them against your Explanation of Benefits EOB This will ensure that you are \\naware of any balance that may be owed after the Allowed Amount has been applied  \\nFinally remember that the Allowed Amount is not a guarantee of payment and that you may \\nbe responsi ble for paying any remaining balance Therefore it is important to review your \\nEOB and contact the provider if

the \\nnetwork providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost  \\nHowever the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind \\nStandard network will not be covered by the plan  \\nWhen you receive health care services its important to identify all of your coverage to the \\nprovider to ensure that the y bill each health plan appropriately

will not adjust the amount of payment \\nmade to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage If a provider has \\nbeen paid by anothe r plan you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind \\nStandard pays its portion of the claim  \\nIf you have other coverage its important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure \\nyou are taking full advantage of your

coverage This means that Northwind Standard will \\npay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays  \\nThe primary and secondary rules that  apply to Northwind Standard are important to \\nunderstand When you have two types of health coverage the primary plan pays first and \\nthe secondary plan pays second The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying \\nthe largest portion of your he althcare costs  \\nFor example if you have a spouse’s health plan and Northwind Standard your spouse’s plan \\nwould be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan This \\nmeans that your spouse’s plan would pay for the majority of your h ealthcare costs and \\nNorthwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs  \\nIt’s important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not \\ncovered by the primary plan Additionally Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses that ex ceed the limits of the primary plan For example if the primary plan has a 1000 \\ndeductible and Northwind Standard has a 500 deductible only the 500 deductible from \\nthe primary plan will be paid  \\nThere are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules For instance if you have \\nMedicare coverage it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind \\nStandard will be the secondary coverage However if you have Medicare Part D for \\nprescription drugs Northwind Standard will be the prim ary coverage and Medicare Part D \\nwill be the secondary coverage  \\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage you may need to \\nprovide evidence of that coverage to your health plan This is known as “creditable \\ncoverage” and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses \\nonce the primary plan has paid  \\nWhen it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules it’s important to remember \\nthat each health plan is different Be sure to review your plan  documents to understand the \\nspecific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage  \\nFinally if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage be sure to reach out to \\nNorthwind Health Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are  always \\navailable to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage  \\nCOBs Effect On

insurance companies coordinate \\nwho pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical \\nexpenses The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer and the \\ncompany that pays second is called the secondary payer  \\nCoordination of Benefits Exceptions  \\nThere are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you If you are covered by \\nMedicare Medicaid or a veterans’ health plan Northwind Standard may pay first even if \\nthe other plan is usually the primary payer Additionally if you are enrolled in a plan that is \\nrequired by law to coordinate benefits such as an employer sponsored plan Northwind \\nStandard may pay first  \\nUnderstanding How COB Affects Your Benefits  \\nWhen COB applies the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible \\nexpenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost Depending on the type of \\nservice the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses When this happen s the \\nsecondary payer may pay nothing  For example if you receive a medical bill for 1000 and the primary payer pays 800 the \\nsecondary payer will pay the remaining balance of 200 However if the primary payer \\npays the full 1000 the secondary pay er will not pay anything  \\nTips for Working with COB  \\nWhen you have multiple health insurance plans it’s important to understand how COB \\nworks and how it can affect your benefits Here are a few tips to help you manage your \\nbenefits  \\n• Make sure that each i nsurance company has all of the necessary information about your \\nother coverage including plan numbers and policy dates  \\n• Confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each \\nother  \\n• Ask your health care providers to submit  claims to both insurance companies  \\n• Understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits  \\n• If you have questions contact each insurance company

what you would have to pay if you were to pay the full cost of the service Copays for Northwind Standard vary depending on the type of service you receive Generally speaking copays for office visits are typically less than copays for hospital visits For example copays for office visits with a prima ry care physician may be 20 while copays for a hospital visit may be up to 150 It is important to

each individual and 4 000 for each family A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay The deduct ible applies to most services received from in network providers including primary care physicians specialists hospitals and pharmacies However there are some exceptions For example preventive care services such as immunizations and annual physic als are covered at 100 with no deductible Additionally prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of 250 per individual and 500 per family It is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year This means that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins to pay Additionally the deductible may not apply to all services For example you may not be subject to the deductible when you receive in network emergency services Tips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible Meeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task but there are a few steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it First take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100 These services are important for your health and you can use them to help meet your deductible without paying out of pocket Second use caut ion when selecting providers The Northwind Standard plan has a large network of in network providers and using these providers will help ensure that you are not paying more than you have to for services Third consider using a health savings account H SA An HSA is a tax advantaged savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses Contributions to an HSA are tax deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical costs Finally take advantage of an y discount programs that may be available Many providers offer discounts for cash payments on services and these can help reduce the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket By following these tips you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind

the cost of the service you receive For example if the coinsurance is 10 you will be responsible for paying 10 of the cost of the service you received while the insurance company pays the other 90 Under Northwind Standard coinsurance is set a t 20 for in network services with some exceptions For in network hospital stays coinsurance is set at 25 Additionally coinsurance for out of network services is set at 40 It s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan s copayment amounts Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance Additionally Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services When you receive services it s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs It s also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out of network services and to consider if it s wort h the cost to pay more for out of network services It s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the pl an your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount not the actual cost If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment Finally it s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out of pocket maximum This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your ou t of pocket maximum faster thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services In summary coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is typically 20 for in network services and 40 for out of networ k services It s important to be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it s worth the cost to pay more for out of network services

Contoso we want our employees to understand the concept of COB Coordination of Benefits so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more than one health plan When an employee has multiple health plans the health plan that pays first is determined by the order of benefit determination Generally the employee s primary health plan pays first followed by the secondary health plan However i f one of the health plans is a Medicare or Medicaid plan that plan pays first

other coverage This means that Northwind Standard will not adjust the amount of payment made to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage If a provider has been paid by anothe r plan you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind Standard pays its portion of the claim If you have other coverage it s important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure you are taking full advantage of your coverage If you need help understanding your plan benefits or have any questions about the coordination of benefits please contact the Northwind Standard Plan Customer Service team We re here to help Primary And Secondary Rules WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE If you ha ve other health coverage such as coverage through a spouse s plan Northwind Standard may

important to understand When you have two types of health coverage the primary plan pays first and the secondary plan pays second The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying the largest portion of your he althcare costs For example if you have a spouse s health plan and Northwind Standard your spouse s plan would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan This means that your spouse s plan would pay for the majority of your h ealthcare costs and Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs It s important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not covered by the primary plan Additionally Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses that ex ceed the limits of the primary plan For example if the primary plan has a 1 000 deductible and Northwind Standard has a 500 deductible only the 500 deductible from the primary plan will be paid There are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules For instance if you have Medicare coverage it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind Standard will be the secondary coverage However if you have Medicare Part D for prescription drugs Northwind Standard will be the prim ary coverage and Medicare Part D will be the secondary coverage It s also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage you may need to provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan This is known as creditable coverage and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses once the primary plan has paid When it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules it s important to remember that each health plan is different Be sure to review your plan documents to understand the specific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage Finally if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage be sure to reach out to Northwind Health Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are always available to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage COB s Effect On Benefits WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE When you have other health insurance coverage coordination of benefits COB can affect how your bene fits are paid COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical expenses The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer and the company that pays second is called the secondary payer Coordination of Benefits Exceptions There are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you If you are covered by Medicare Medicaid or a veterans health plan Northwind Standard may pay first even if the other plan is usually the primary payer Additionally if you are enrolled in a plan that is required by law to coordinate benefits such as an employer sponsored plan Northwind Standard may pay first Understanding How COB Affects Your Benefits When COB applies the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost Depending on the type of service the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses When this happen s the secondary payer may pay nothing For example if you receive a medical bill for 1 000 and the primary payer pays 800 the secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of 200 However if the primary payer pays the full 1 000 the secondary pay er will not pay anything Tips for Working with COB When you have multiple health insurance plans it s important to understand how COB works and how it can affect your benefits Here are a few tips to help you manage your benefits Make sure that each i nsurance company has all of the necessary information about your other coverage including plan numbers and policy dates Confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each other Ask your health care providers to submit claims to both insurance companies Understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits If you have questions contact each insurance company for clarification Overall it s important to understand how COB works and how it affects your benefits By being aware of the rules and exceptions you can ensure that you are getting the full coverage you need from both insurance companies Subrogation And Reimbursement Subrogation And Reimbursement When you have other health coverage such as Medicare or another employer s health plan Northwind Standard may still provide coverage in certain circumstances This is called subrogation and reimbursement Subrogation and reimbursement works when anothe r health plan pays for a service that is covered by Northwind Standard In this case Northwind Standard will pay for the same service assuming that it was medically necessary and you received it from an in network provider If Northwind Standard pays for a service that is already covered by your other health plan you may be responsible for reimbursing Northwind Standard This can happen if you do not provide Northwind Standard with proof of your other coverage There are certain exceptions to subrogation and reimbursement If you are a Medicare beneficiary Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from Medicare In addition Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from any other health plan if the service you received is not covered by the ot her health plan When filing claims it is important to keep in mind that you need to provide Northwind Standard with proof of your other coverage This can include a copy of your other plan s Explanation of Benefits EOB or a letter from the other health plan
